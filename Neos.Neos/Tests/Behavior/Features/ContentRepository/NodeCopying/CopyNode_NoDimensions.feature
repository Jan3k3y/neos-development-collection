Feature: Copy nodes (without dimensions)

  Background:
    Given using no content dimensions
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document':
      references:
        ref: []
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                | Value           |
      | workspaceName      | "live"          |
      | newContentStreamId | "cs-identifier" |
    And I am in workspace "live"
    And the command CreateRootNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                         |
      | nodeAggregateId | "lady-eleonode-rootford"      |
      | nodeTypeName    | "Neos.ContentRepository:Root" |
    And the event NodeAggregateWithNodeWasCreated was published with payload:

  Scenario: Copy
    When I am in workspace "live" and dimension space point {}
    When copy nodes recursively is executed with payload:
      | Key                                    | Value                                                             |
      | sourceDimensionSpacePoint              | {}                                                                |
      | sourceNodeAggregateId                  | "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii"                                      |
      | targetDimensionSpacePoint              | {}                                                                |
      | targetParentNodeAggregateId            | "nody-mc-nodeface"                                                |
      | targetNodeName                         | "target-nn"                                                       |
      | targetSucceedingSiblingnodeAggregateId | null                                                              |
      | nodeAggregateIdMapping                 | {"sir-nodeward-nodington-iii": "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii-copy"} |

    Then I expect node aggregate identifier "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii-copy" to lead to node cs-identifier;sir-nodeward-nodington-iii-copy;{}
    And I expect the node aggregate "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii-copy" to exist
    And I expect this node aggregate to be classified as "regular"
    And I expect this node aggregate to be named "target-nn"
    And I expect this node aggregate to be of type "Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document"
    And I expect this node aggregate to occupy dimension space points [[]]
    And I expect this node aggregate to disable dimension space points []
    And I expect this node aggregate to have no child node aggregates
    And I expect this node aggregate to have the parent node aggregates ["nody-mc-nodeface"]

  Scenario: Copy References
    When I am in workspace "live" and dimension space point {}
    And the command SetNodeReferences is executed with payload:
      | Key                   | Value                                                                            |
      | sourceNodeAggregateId | "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii"                                                     |
      | references            | [{"referenceName": "ref", "references": [{"target": "sir-david-nodenborough"}]}] |

    When copy nodes recursively is executed with payload:
      | Key                                    | Value                                                             |
      | sourceDimensionSpacePoint              | {}                                                                |
      | sourceNodeAggregateId                  | "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii"                                      |
      | targetDimensionSpacePoint              | {}                                                                |
      | targetParentNodeAggregateId            | "nody-mc-nodeface"                                                |
      | targetNodeName                         | "target-nn"                                                       |
      | targetSucceedingSiblingnodeAggregateId | null                                                              |
      | nodeAggregateIdMapping                 | {"sir-nodeward-nodington-iii": "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii-copy"} |

    And I expect node aggregate identifier "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii-copy" to lead to node cs-identifier;sir-nodeward-nodington-iii-copy;{}
    And I expect this node to have the following references:
      | Name | Node                                    | Properties |
      | ref  | cs-identifier;sir-david-nodenborough;{} | null       |
